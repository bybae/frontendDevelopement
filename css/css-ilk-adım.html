        [Verse 1]
        <br> 
I can just hear them now,
how could you let us down? 
    <br> 
But they don't know what I found,
or see it from this way 'round,
    <br>
Feeling it overtake,
All that I used to hate,
    <br>
One by one, every trait,
i tried, but it's way too late,
    <br>
All the signs I don't read,
two sides of me can't agree,
    <br>
Will I be in too deep?
going with what I always longed for
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    [Chorus]
    <br> 
Feel like a brand new person
(But you'll make the same old mistakes)
    <br>
I don't care, I'm in love
(Stop before it's too late)
    <br>
(I know) Feel like a brand new person
(But you'll make the same old mistakes)
    <br>
I finally know what it's like (You don't have what it takes)
(Stop before it's too late)
    <br>
(I know there's too much at stake)
(Making the same mistakes)
    <br>
And I still don't know why it's happening
(Stop while it's not too late)
And I still don't know
    <br> 
</p>

    [Verse 2]
    <br> 
Finally taking flight
I know you don't think it's right
    <br>
I know that you think it's fake
Maybe fake's what I like
    <br>
The point is, I have the right
Not thinking in black and white
    <br>
I'm thinking it's worth the fight
Soon to be out of sight
    <br>
Knowing it all this time
Going with what I always longed for
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    [Chorus]
    <br> 
Feel like a brand new person
(But you'll make the same old mistakes)
    <br>
I don't care, I'm in love
(Stop before it's too late)
    <br>
Feel like a brand new person
(But you'll make the same old mistakes)
    <br>
So how do I know I've gone too far? (You don't have what it takes)
(Stop before it's too late)
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    [Bridge]
    <br> 
Man, I know that it's hard to digest
But maybe your story ain't so different from the rest
And I know it seems wrong to accept
    <br>
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
And I know that it's hard to digest
    <br>
A realisation is as good as a guess
And I know it seems wrong to accept
    <br>
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    [Outro]
    <br> 
Feel like a brand new person
So, how will I know that it's right?
    <br>
In a new direction
So, how will I know I've gone too far?
    <br>
(Stop thinking that the only option was)
Feel like a brand new person
    <br>
I finally know what it's like
(Stop thinking that the only option was)
    <br>
In a new direction
So how will I know I've gone too far?
    <br>
(Stop thinking that the only option was)
And I know it's hard to describe
    <br>
(Stop thinking that the only option was)
So how will I know that it's right?
